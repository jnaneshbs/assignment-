        &emsp; As you grow up, make the transition from school to college, and eventually get a job, you understand by then that versatility is an important thing.The wonder of versatility is such that it can trump almost anything. If you are versatile, if you
        can adapt, you will do good. In case you are wondering why an article about the top battery manufacturers of India is talking about versatility, your concern is justified. But, the thing about batteries is that of all the electronic items, it
        is perhaps that one equipment that justifies versatility from the first letter to the last.<br> 2017 was a good year for Indian battery manufacturers, and so was the year before that. In fact, India's battery manufacturing industry has
        consistently been one of the biggest.

                Founded by IIT-Kanpur graduates Pulkit Khurana and Siddharth Sikka, Battery Smart is targeting a $17b swapping market by 2025 with the vision to have a Swap Station at every one square km area in the Delhi-NCR region. We are working with various players
                in the industry, including battery manufacturers, OEMs, the driver community, and startups, to build a robust ecosystem that can help drivers easily shift to a more economical EV model.

                The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has signed an MoU with BHEL to manufacture lithium-ion batteries for Electric Vehicle in India. also In June, ISRO announced a decision to transfer its lithium-ion cell technology to the Indian industry on
                a non-exclusive basis for use in automobiles for Rs 1 crore

                Challenges and Opportunities: While we witness great excitement and rapid growth in the EV segment in the country with an increasing number of E-vehicles on the roads, it is just the beginning and a long way to go before we can claim that we have built
                a matured and self-reliant ecosystem in the country.
            </div>
            <div class="ind" id="ind2">
                A secure raw material supply for batteries and an optimised supply chain setup are vital for the EV transition. To reach India’s ambitious domestic cell manufacturing capacity target, say 100 GWh by 2030, it would require about Lithium-10 kt, Nickel-30
                kt,Cobalt-5 kt,and Graphite-110 kt (depending on technology), which are not available in India. So, we should have a mechanism to access these materials through the government’s G-G initiatives.
